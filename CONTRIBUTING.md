# Contribution Guidelines

Thanks for your interest in contributing to one of my projects!

To report issues or request features, use the "Issues" tab.

When making a pull request, please note this repository enforces linear
commit history and commit signing. Please ensure your development branch
is up to date before attempting to make any changes, and rebase onto main
before pushing commits. You should have a signing key configured for your
account - SSH is preferred. You can learn more about how to do that
[in the GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification#ssh-commit-signature-verification).
